The J8 on the middle of the board is the power selection terminal, it needs to be short circuited only when the type-C USB is used to supply power to the motherboard or the USB is used to supply power externally. The signal of type-C is connected to the SoC, Only used when writing OS image for CM4 eMMC version. Hardware Installation \u00b6 Stepper Driver \u00b6 Normal STEP/DIR(STANDALONE) Mode \u00b6 For example, A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820...use the jumper cap to short MS0-MS2 according to the driver subdivision table. Note: If using A4988or DRV8825, RST and SLP must be shorted with jumper caps for normal operation. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART Mode of TMC Driver \u00b6 For example, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225... Use a jumper cap for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware. SPI Mode of TMC Driver \u00b6 For example, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161... Use 4 jumper caps for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware. DIAG(Sensorless Homing) of TMC Driver \u00b6 As shown in the figure, plug the jumper cap when using the Sensorless Homing function, and leave it unplugged when it is not used. There is no need to cut the DIAG pin of the driver. Driver Voltage Selection \u00b6 The power supply of each driver can be set by the jumper. When the jumper is inserted into the left side, the independent MOTOR POWER port is used for driver power, and the supported voltage up to 56V. When the jumper is inserted into the right side, the main POWER port is used for driver power, and the 12/24v voltage is supported. Driver independent power supply The jumper is inserted into the left side and powered by the MOTOR POWER port. the supported voltage up to 56V. Main power supply The jumper is inserted into the right side and powered by the main POWER port. the 12/24v voltage is supported. Install the Core Board via BTB Connection \u00b6 M4P+CM4\uff1aPay attention to the direction, as shown below. M4P+CB1\uff1aPay attention to the direction, as shown below. 40 pin GPIO \u00b6 When working with CM4, the pin arrangement of 40 Pin GPIO is exactly the same as that of Raspberry Pi. When working with CB1, it is a custom IO arrangement, as shown in the figure below, the 'GPIO4' in front of '_' is the IO of CM4, and the latter 'PC7' is the IO of CB1.

For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html For example, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225... Use a jumper cap for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware. SPI Mode of TMC Driver \u00b6 For example, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161... Use 4 jumper caps for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware.
